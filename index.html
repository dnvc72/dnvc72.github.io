        <h2 id="heading">The History of Dinuguan</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Dinuguan</strong> is a stew from <strong><u>The Philippines</u></strong> made of diced pork, pork blood and intestines (deer sometimes substitutes) and flavored with spices, onions, garlic, siling haba chili, and vinegar.
            It's extremely flavorful, and almost always paired with steamed rice. <br>
            And behind such a rich dish, is a rich history.<br>
            Because pigs are native to the Philippines, the dish may be <em>pre-Spanish colonialism</em>.
            However, in former Spanish colonies like Guam, there is <em>Fritada</em> (<u>Not to be confused with <em>Fritatta</em></u>), a very similar dish also flavored with pig blood.
            This suggests that Dinuguan may have diffused through Spanish culture to its different colonies, and was given different names and modifications.
            In Filipino, "Dinuguan" loosely translates to "bloodied" but Fritada comes from the Spanish verb "Fritar" which means "fried", even though Fritada isn't fried, but commonly braised or slow-cooked, like Dinuguan.
            The 2 colonies difference in location and language contributed to their differences. Dinuguan is also eaten in the Marianas Islands, which is very close to The Philippines and Guam. 
            It's believed to have been introduced by Filipino immigrants, but because of its closer proximity to Guam, it's locally known as "Fritada".<br>
            One thing is for certain: Dinuguan has become such a staple as it can last up to a week without refrigeration, and in the Philippines, there has always been an 
            economic need to use every part of a butchered animal.
            The dish varies by region, with different methods of cooking, in the <em>Ilocos</em>, <em>Bicol</em>, and <em>Pampanga</em> region. Today, it is still a beloved dish in the Philippines, and is popularly served at fiestas and buffets across the country.
